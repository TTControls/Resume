\section{Projects \small{(Notable)}}

\runsubsection{Stack}
\descript{| C\#, SQL Server, React.js}
\begin{tightemize}
\item A palletization pattern solving application. Consequently, the solved pattern data is transmitted to a robot as location and orientation coordinates. The application incorporates features such reactive pattern editing, real-time peripheral device monitoring, and querying configurations. The application is patented, providing a robust palletization solution that helps the company maintain high-quality standards across its product line.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Pick}
\descript{| Python}
\begin{tightemize}
\item A middle-ware application responsible for interfacing a vision system's procedure calls, a robot's serial communication, and an automation controller's socket connection. By leveraging incoming data, analysis tools enhanced the precision of model training and pick performance. This innovative solution simplifies interfacing multiple manufacturers' communication requirements, allowing scalable and efficient automation design.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Motion}
\descript{| Automation Controller/Pascal}
\begin{tightemize}
\item A specialized motion controller for hydraulic position, velocity, and force control. A custom PID loop, target modeling, and feedback tuning allowed unmatched actuator precision. The control algorithm was designed to be integrated into any automation controller, giving the company's hydraulic applications a competitive edge in the marketplace.
