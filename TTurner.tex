\descript{| Software Engineer}
\location{1 year | September 2022 – Current | Maryland Heights, MO}
\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\item Utilized Python and .NET C\# to create middleware solutions for automation controllers, robots, and vision systems. These solutions improved communication capabilities among peripheral devices and automated statistical data collection for tracking performance.
\item Transitioned products from R\&D to manufacturing, focusing on continuous improvement in integration testing and product statistics. Effectively identified and resolved issues, streamlined the product production and documentation, and improved overall product quality.

\runsubsection{Beckwood Press}
\descript{| Electrical Controls Engineer }
\location{6 years | October 2016 – September 2022 | Fenton, MO}
\begin{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\item Designed and implemented numerical methods and closed-loop control systems for custom hydraulic and servo presses. Utilized automation controllers and python to develop target generation, signal filtering, and linearization algorithms, leading to significant improvement in material forming quality.
\item Facilitated team collaboration to learn and prioritize low-level solutions. Our team helped grow electrical design structures for accelerated development and integration. Additionally, we created analytic tools through extensive data collection to showcase product performance and competitiveness within the marketplace.

\runsubsection{EPIC Inc.}
\descript{| Electrical Controls Technician }
\location{2 years | December 2014 – October 2016 | St. Louis, MO}
\begin{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\item Oversaw the assembly and design of electrical panels and machine wiring for pilot plants, vision systems, and custom machines. The multidisciplinary nature of these products gave the opportunity to be cross-trained in mechanical and process design. 
\item Implemented designs that conformed to sanitary/wash-down, Class I Division I, and National Electric Code requirements.

\runsubsection{Stack}
\descript{| C\#, SQL Server, React.js}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a web application using C\#/ASP.NET Core and React/Next.js with TypeScript. The application solves palletization patterns based on product dimensions and layer requirements, then writing location and orientation commands to a robot. It incorporates features like device creation and configuration saving using Entity Framework Core and MS SQL Server. The application is patented, providing a robust palletization solution that helps the company maintain high-quality standards across its product line.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Pick}
\descript{| Python}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Maintained a Python application that interfaces with a vision system's procedure calls and serializes communication to robots and automation controllers. The system incorporates a Flask server, allowing an automation HMI to operate other devices via REST API calls. Furthermore, data analysis tools enhance the precision of model training and motion planning by leveraging incoming data. This innovative solution simplifies the interfacing with multiple manufacturers, allowing scalable and efficient automation process.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Motion}
\descript{| Automation Controller/Pascal}
\begin{tightemize}
\item A specialized motion controller for hydraulic position, velocity, and force control. It incorporates set point modeling for target generation and feedback tuning to enhance accuracy. The control algorithm can be integrated into any automation controller, giving the company's hydraulic applications a competitive edge in the marketplace.
